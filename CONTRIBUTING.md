# Contributing to Cartesi Todo List

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

## The Fantastic Four

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let's meet the dream team behind this blockchain-powered procrastination enabler:

1. **Bhargava Sharabha** - The Overachiever
   * Known for doing most of the work while simultaneously inventing new ways to caffeinate.
   * If the code works, thank Bhargava. If it doesn't, also thank Bhargava (he's probably fixing it as you read this).

2. **Hrithik** - The Wild Card
   * Specializes in coming up with brilliant ideas right after Bhargava has finished implementing the previous one.
   * Excellent at providing moral support and occasional rubber duck debugging.

3. **Nithin Raj** - The Optimist
   * Firmly believes that all bugs are just undocumented features.
   * Expertise includes creative excuses for missed deadlines and finding the perfect memes for code reviews.

4. **Gopi Krishna** - The Idea Guy 
   * Role varies between "voice of reason" and "chaos instigator" depending on caffeine levels.
   * Holds the current record for most consecutive hours staring at a loading screen.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**
   * Yes, like forking your food, but with less mess and more code.

2. **Create a Branch**
   * Please name your branch something more creative than `asdfghjkl`. We're looking at you, Gopi.

3. **Make Your Changes**
   * Write code that even Bhargava would be proud of (a high bar, we know).
   * If you break it, you buy it... or fix it. Preferably fix it.

4. **Test Your Changes**
   * Remember, "It works on my machine" is not a valid test strategy.
   * If Nithin can't find a way to break it, you're probably good to go.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   * Write a description that would make Hrithik proud. Bonus points for including a relevant meme.

6. **Code Review**
   * Prepare for constructive feedback, witty comments, and the occasional "Why didn't I think of that?" from Bhargava.

7. **Merge**
   * If your code survives Bhargava's scrutiny, Hrithik's ideas, Nithin's optimism, and Gopi's wild card energy, congratulations! You've made it!

## Code of Conduct

1. Be nice, or at least fake it convincingly.
2. Coffee is sacred. Do not touch another's coffee unless you're bringing them a refill.
3. Puns are encouraged, but use them responsibly.
4. In the event of a zombie apocalypse, protect Bhargava at all costs. He's our best shot at coding our way out of it.

## Questions?

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue. If Bhargava doesn't answer within 0.5 seconds, he's probably sleeping (for the first time this week), so please be patient.

Remember, we're all here to have fun, learn, and create something awesome. Don't take yourself too seriously ‚Äì we certainly don't!

Happy coding, and may the odds be ever in your favor!
