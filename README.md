## Technology Stack

- Backend: Python with Cartesi's DApp framework
- Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- Blockchain Integration: eth_abi, Cartesi Rollups
- Development Environment: Cartesi's local development tools

## Challenges

We faced numerous challenges, including mastering Cartesi's technology, optimizing blockchain data management, and creating a user-friendly interface for blockchain interactions. Our team's varying levels of productivity added an extra layer of complexity, but we persevered with a sense of humor and determination.

## Accomplishments

We successfully created a fully functional, decentralized todo list application that seamlessly blends blockchain security with user-friendly design. Our team mastered Cartesi's innovative technology, implemented efficient off-chain computations, and developed an intuitive interface that makes blockchain interaction accessible to non-technical users.

## What We Learned

We learned that "blockchain" isn't just a buzzword to impress dates, coffee can be a valid food group, and that "decentralized" perfectly describes our sleep schedules. Oh, and apparently, Cartesi isn't a fancy Italian sports car. Who knew?
